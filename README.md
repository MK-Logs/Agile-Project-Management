# Project Management

The final project assignments from my Agile Project Management Course. The Scrum Release Plan features the project planning documents for the rollout of an Employee Benefits Portal System. The development process will follow the Scrum methodology. The SimAgile Execution Report outlines the project execution results. The simulation mimicked real world project conditions. The end result of the simulation was successful with the MVP being delivered, planned objectives being met, and the stakeholders satisfied. Overall, the project was completed on scope, time, and budget.
